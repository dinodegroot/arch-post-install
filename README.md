# arch-post-install
My script to configure everything I need on a clean Arch installation.
Make sure you can run "sudo" without a password prompt before running this.
Run the script with the following command:
curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dinodegroot/arch-post-install/refs/heads/main/setup.sh | sh
